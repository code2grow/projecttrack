The original version of Project Track appeared as the example application in Kito Mann's JavaServer Faces in Application. Chris Richardson, author of POJOs in Action, then developed Spring, and Hibernate backend, integrated Acegi Security, and wrote some Selenium tests.

The goal is for Project Track to be an example of how to build applications with JSF, Spring, Hibernate, and Acegi Security.
